small dots = OTUs
larger dots = serotypes

length of line = p-value
- longer = less significant
- shorter = more significant

width of line = fold change
- thicker = higher fold change
- thinner = lower fold change

transparency of line = fold change
- less transparent = higer fold change
- more transparent = lower fold change

color of small dots = phylogenetic similarity 
- color gradient pinkish to greenish
- colors that are opposite on the color wheel are on opposite sides of
  the phylogentic tree

size of serotype nodes = number of samples containing that serotype
- larger = more samples
- smaller = less samples

If an OTU node is connected to a serotype node with a yellow line, it
means that that OTU was significantly upregulated by only that
serotype. If it is connected by a blue line, then that OTU is
significantly downregulated only by that OTU.

There are more OTUs that were either significantly upregulated or
downregulated by each OTU, but only the ones that were unique to each
OTU are on the star graph.

Statistical test = kruskal wallis

No bonferroni or benjammaini (spelling?) correction was used as there
were so many statistical comparisons (as there were so many OTUs) that
almost none of the OTUs would be significant with the correction. This
means that some of the OTUs that pass the p-value cutoff might
actually be false positives.
